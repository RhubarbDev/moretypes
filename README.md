# moretypes
adds 'char' and 'pair' which could be useful (but probably aren't)

I wanted to see if it was possible to make a class that could act as a pair for an upcoming project, which I figured out I could pretty easily, so I wondered what other 
types I could add. This probably isn't particularly useful but I wanted to understand you use [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/moredatatypes/) so I decided to make it into a package that I might update
in the future (possibly?)
